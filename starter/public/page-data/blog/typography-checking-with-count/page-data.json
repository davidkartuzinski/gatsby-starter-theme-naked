Marseilles- The Arrival\n\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.\n\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\n\nImmediately, and _according to custom_, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city.\n\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and **Jaros islands**; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot.\n\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.\n\nWhen the **young man on board** saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.\n\nHe was a _fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty_, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\n\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”\n\n“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.”\n\n“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.\n\n“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But poor Captain Leclere——”\n\n“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”\n\n“He died.”\n\n“Fell into the sea?”\n\n“No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”\n\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner.\n\n“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation.\n\n![Edmond Dantès ](./edmond-dantes.jpg \"Edmond Dantès\")\n_First Image: We meet our hero, Edmond Dantès_\n\n“Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere [left Naples](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-naples-italy.html) greatly disturbed in mind. In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “**to make war against the English** for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”\n\n> Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it;\n> and I advise you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.\n\n“Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted at every moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo——”\n\n“Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.”\n\nThen, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted: “Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!”\n\nThe order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-of-war.\n\n“Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.\n\n“Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the owner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.”\n\nThe owner did not wait for _a second invitation_. He seized a rope which Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made **him as much disliked by the crew** as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.\n\n“Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us?”\n\n“Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.”\n\n> Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.\n\n“And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars.\n\n“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone.”\n\n“Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. “Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”\n\n![The Pharaon](./the-pharoan.jpg \"The Pharaon\")\n\n“As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”\n\n“The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”\n\n“Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this way!”\n\n“In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to the crew, he said, “Let go!”\n\nThe anchor was _instantly dropped_, and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!”\n\n“You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my word.”\n\n“And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.\n\n“Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.”\n\n“And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.”\n\nA cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.\n\n“Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?”\n\nDanglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?”\n\n“I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”\n\n“Then did you see him, Edmond?”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“The marshal.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nMorrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly—\n\n“And how is the emperor?”\n\n“Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”\n\n“You saw the emperor, then?”\n\n“He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”\n\n“And you spoke to him?”\n\n“Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.\n\n“And what did he say to you?”\n\n“Asked me questions about the vessel, **the time she left Marseilles**, the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’”\n\n“Pardieu! and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.”\n\n![Dantès on Board](./dantes-on-board.jpg \"Dantès on Board\")\n\n---\n","frontmatter":{"author":"David Kartuzinski","date":"2020-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2020-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","description":"We check out typography by using The Count of Monte Cristo as a source of great content.","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.6722689075630253,"src":"/static/11bf5a29cc5c13fa09978c1b85f44096/88219/count-of-monte-cristo-book-cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/11bf5a29cc5c13fa09978c1b85f44096/40426/count-of-monte-cristo-book-cover.jpg 240w,\n/static/11bf5a29cc5c13fa09978c1b85f44096/9104c/count-of-monte-cristo-book-cover.jpg 480w,\n/static/11bf5a29cc5c13fa09978c1b85f44096/88219/count-of-monte-cristo-book-cover.jpg 667w","sizes":"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"}},"publicURL":"/static/11bf5a29cc5c13fa09978c1b85f44096/count-of-monte-cristo-book-cover.jpg"},"slug":"typography-checking-with-count","title":"Typography checking with the Count","categories":["Markdown","Mdx","Gatsby"],"tags":["mdx","editor","markdown"],"imageAlt":"Book Cover to the Conte of Monte Cristo Book","imageFigcaption":"Book Cover to the Conte of Monte Cristo Book","canonical":""},"id":"20e4df4d-d723-5351-a3d3-39b2c1882f1c"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/typography-checking-with-count","next":null,"previous":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"markdown-cheatsheet-mdx-gatsby","title":"Markdown Cheatsheet in MDX and Gatsby"}},"breadcrumb":{"location":"/blog/typography-checking-with-count","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/blog","crumbLabel":"blog"},{"pathname":"/blog/typography-checking-with-count","crumbLabel":"typography-checking-with-count"}]}}}}
